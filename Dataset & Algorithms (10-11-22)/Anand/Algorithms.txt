The problem is to predict the house price using linear regression. 
Many algorithms can be used to solve this problem two of them are given below:

1. Multi-Linear regression :- This algorithm takes two variables, one independent and one
dependant variable and performs regression based on those variables.
2. Randm Forest Regression :- Using many decision trees, regression can be performed on the
dataset to achieve the prediction succesfully.
