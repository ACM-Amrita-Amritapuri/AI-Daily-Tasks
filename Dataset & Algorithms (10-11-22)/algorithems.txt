
Linear regression-
 Linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables.
 A regression equation (or function) is linear when it is linear in the parameters.

Polynomial regression-
 Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x.
 Polynomial regression is one of the machine learning algorithms used for making predictions.
