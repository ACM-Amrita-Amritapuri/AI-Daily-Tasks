Linear regression : Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. 
The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

Ploynomial regression : Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is
 modeled as an nth degree polynomial.
