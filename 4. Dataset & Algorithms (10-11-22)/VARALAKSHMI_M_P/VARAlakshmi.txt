1.Algorithmic trading is a process for executing orders utilizing automated and preprogrammed trading instructions to account for variables such as price, timing and
volume. An algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem. Computer algorithms send small portions of the full order to the market over time.
The objective of the project is to implement momentum strategy using machine learning.
2.Here we are predicting trading signals using machine learning techniques based on a set of rules using technical indicators.
And then we check the predictions for a particular stock using linear regressions .
